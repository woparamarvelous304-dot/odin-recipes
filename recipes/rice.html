    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Jollof rice is a dish with deep roots in West African culture, and it’s one that carries with it a sense of community, celebration, and tradition.</p>

    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Red bell pepper</li>
        <li>Vine tomatoes</li>
        <li>Red onion</li>
        <li>Red scotch bonnet chillies</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Fresh ginger</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Double concentrated tomato purée (DeRica)</li>
        <li>Curry powder</li>
        <li>Dried thyme</li>
        <li>Chicken stock cubes</li>
        <li>Dried bay leaves</li>
        <li>White basmati rice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the base ingredients in a blender and blitz until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven set over a medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes, then add the tomato purée and cook, stirring frequently, until it begins to darken, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in the blended base, stir to combine and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low and partially cover the pot with the lid – it will splatter! Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is reduced by about a third of its original volume and the oil begins to separate from the sauce, 12 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the curry powder, thyme, stock cubes, bay leaves and water. Season generously with salt and pepper, to taste, then cover and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, rinse the rice thoroughly with cold water until the water runs clean, then drain. Add the rice to the sauce and stir to combine. As soon as it comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot and cook for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>By this point, the rice should have absorbed all the liquid and be cooked through. Remove the bay leaves, give the rice a stir and you’re ready to serve, preferably with grilled chicken and fried plantain.</li>
    </ol>
